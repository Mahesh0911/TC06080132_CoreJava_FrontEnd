/*
 *	Comparator Interface :
 *		Comparator interface present in "java.util" package.
 *	  	This interface defines the 2 methods :
 *			1)	public int compare(Object o1,Object o2);
 *			2)	public boolean equals(Object obj);
 *
 *		Whenever we are implementing Comparator interface we have to provide implementation for compare() method.
 *		implementing equals() method is optional because it is already available from Object class through inheritance
 *
 *		Note :
 *			Whenever we are defining our own customized sorting by Comparator then the objects 
 *			need not be Comparable.
