/*
 *	Demystifying Multi :
 *		Multitasking : doing more than one task at a time.
 *		Multiprocessing : running more than one process simultaneously.
 *		WinAmp = listening songs
 *		WinWord = creating a document
 *		Multithreading =running multiple threads concurrently
 *		
 * 
 * 	MultiProcessing - Context Switch
 * 		When OS switching between process to process , data needs to be stored temporarily.
 * 		Data to be stored : Context
 * 			-Instruction Set
 * 			-Current Instruction
 * 			-Current data structures in use
 * 		Processes do not share the same data,hence context switch is resource heavy.
 * 		Scheduling of process is controlled by OS : 
 * 			two ways :
 * 				1) Pre-emptive
 * 				2) Non Preemptive (Co operative)
 *
