/*
 * Map Interface :
 * 	If we want to represent group of objects as key-value pairs.
 * 	No duplicate keys , but values can be duplicate.
 * 	Each key-value pair is one entry.
 * 	Map interface is not child interface of Collection and hence we can't apply Collection interface methods here.
 *  
 *	HashMap : 
 *		Underlying data structure is Hashtable.
 *		Stores in pairs of key-values.
 *		Duplicates keys not allowed.
 * 		Insertion order is not preserved , it is based on Hash Keys.
 *		null key not allowed.
 *		Every method present inside Hashtable is synchronized and hence Hashtable is thread safe.
