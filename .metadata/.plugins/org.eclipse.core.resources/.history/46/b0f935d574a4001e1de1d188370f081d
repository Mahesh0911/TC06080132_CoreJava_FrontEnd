 * Priority Queue :
 * 		PQ is data structure to represent a group of individual objects prior to processing according to some priority.
 * 		Priority order can be either default natural order or customized sorting order specified by Comparator object.
 * 		For default natural order objects must be homogeneous and comparable otherwise we get ClassCastException.
 *		Duplicates are not allowed.
 *		Insertion order is not preserved but all objects will be inserted according to some priority. 
 * 		Null is not allowed even as the 1st element for empty priority queue.
