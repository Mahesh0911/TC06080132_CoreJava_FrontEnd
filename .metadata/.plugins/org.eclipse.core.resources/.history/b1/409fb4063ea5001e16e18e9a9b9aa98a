/*
 *	Thread : *** Thread run at Hardware level not at software level. ***
 *		
 *		Used by thread scheduler to decide when each thread should be allowed to run.
 *		Threads of equal priority compete with for CPU.
 *		Thread scheduler picks up the highest priority thread that is currently runnable.
 *		Priority levels range from 1(MIN_PRIORITY) to 10(MAX_PRIORITY).
 *		5(NORM_PRIORITY) is the default priority level.
 * 
 * 		Thread can be executed by extending Thread class or implementing runnable interface.
 * 		As java doesn't support Multiple inheritance so extending Thread class make it unable to extend any other class,
 * 		So, we can use runnable interface if we want to extend other class also.
 *
 * 
 * 	ThreadGroup :
 * 		It would be useful to categorize them by functionality, so that you can work simultaneously with number of threads.
 * 		Class ThreadGroup contains methods for creating and manipulating group of threads.
 * 		ThreadGroup(ThreadGroup parent,String name)
